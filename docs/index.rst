discord-interactions
====================
No more hassle with trying to get interactions to work with your Python Discord bot
-- **discord-interactions** is now here.

**discord-interactions** is a simple API wrapper for Discord interactions.
We're not here to replace discord.py or any other fork, but we are here to be the very best 
Python Discord library there is that implements interactions very well. This is what our 
library is all about.

What are we good for?
*********************
We offer a **lot** of benefits with using our library:

* Modern pythonic design that is scalable and modular.
* Asynchronous coroutines and multi-threading capabilities.
* Optimal class object reference with little overhead.
* Easily accessible codebase source.
* Stable/unstable branches for managing module stability when importing.

What does that mean?
********************
Basically, we're good and bad for these things:

* ✔️ Working with application commands.
* ✔️ Handling contextual data cached from all channels.
* ✔️ General/basic assignment of guild properties to members.
* ✔️ Responsive callbacks for buttons and select menus.
* ✔️ Voice client capabilities.
* ❌ Cooldowns/bucket types.

Where do I start?
