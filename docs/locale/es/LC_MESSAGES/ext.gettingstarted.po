msgid ""
"Getting started with making a 3rd party library is pretty hard. Most of "
"the time, you'll find yourself often checking the source code and "
"directly making changes to the library. We want to make a change to that,"
" and additionally, make it easier for developers to find creativity in "
"the simplicity of our overengineered product."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:14
msgid ""
"If you're not familiar with the source code of the library, you should "
"probably read the documentation first."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:17
msgid ""
"Basing your 3rd party libraries off of our ``unstable`` branch is a bad "
"practice as this is regarded as our development branch. Breaking changes "
"may become common, and as a result pose a risk in affecting your 3rd "
"party. For this reason, we recommend you use the latest PyPI release or "
"``stable`` branch."

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:26
msgid ""
"Installing the external framework is a rather trivial process. You do not"
" need to run any special installation on the library, as this comes built"
" into our main core. However, you will need to install the dependencies "
"involved with the library."

"If you do not already have this library installed, you can do with this "

msgid "Creating the base."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:41
msgid ""
"For every official 3rd party library of interactions.py, we have a "
"\"core\" for it, otherwise known as the base. This base is what we use to"
" allow developers to easily setup their project onto PyPI and build, as "
"well as storing additional information that bot developers can read off "
"of for their bots."

msgid "This code shows a basic example for creating the base of a 3rd party:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:71
msgid ""
"This configures the base of the library in a rather simple manner: you "
"give the name and description of the 3rd party, as well as its own "
"official version and link for reference. This is all that is required to "
"build the library. The rest of the field that can be filled in are "
"optional. You can look at the :ref:`Base class <ext.base:Core Model>` for"
" more information."

msgid "Defining a version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:80
msgid ""
"As you may have noticed in the ``Base`` class, we have a ``Version`` "
"class that helps define the version of the 3rd party. This is required to"
" be written in our class for numerous reasons:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Forced semantic versioning."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:87
msgid ""
"This class is our most advanced and complicated one due to the abundant "
"nature in emphasising a proper versioning system. We have a few options "
"for versioning, and we have a few rules to follow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:90
msgid ""
"Major, minor and patch versions **must** be declared as either their "
"respective key-word arguments, or under the ``version`` kwarg."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:91
msgid ""
"The version should not be author-less. Every library has an author behind"
" a version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:92
msgid ""
"The version should not be a pre-release. Pre-releases are not supported "
"by the official PyPI. To release as alpha or beta, use the "
"``extend_version()`` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:93
msgid ""
"A version cannot contain more than 1 main author. If you have multiple "
"authors, you should label them as co-authors instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:94
msgid "An alphanumeric version can only contain one instance of its own."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:96
msgid ""
"With these rules out of the way, let's look at a simple implementation of"
" the ``Version`` class alongside its brother, ``VersionAuthor`` for "
"adding authors of a version:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:120
msgid ""
"This code example can also show you the ways of retreiving information "
"from a version. As seen here, this is a highly versatile class. These "
"following are the shown methods and their purposes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:124
msgid "The ``version`` attribute is the version string."

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:127
msgid "The ``patch`` attribute is the patch version number, e.g. \"0.0.x\""
msgstr ""

"The ``authors`` property method is a list of authors, regardless of if "
"one is a co-author or not."

"The ``is_alphanumeric`` property method is a boolean that indicates if "
"the version is alphanumeric."

msgid "Converting models from one to another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:134
msgid ""
"The term \"conversion\" is a gross exaggeration of what we're actually "
"doing here. The problem that we've found with bot developers cross-"
"referencing from different libraries is that their data models are simply"
" different in design and structure. In order to combat against this, we "
"have decided to create a conversion tool that will allow us to convert "
"between models. This tool also allows for better comparison that will "
"save the average developer many lines of code from having to be written. "
"This is a basic example of how we \"convert\" these models:"

msgid "What about errors?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext.gettingstarted.rst:164
msgid ""
"Don't worry---we've got you covered there. Each of our tools will raise "
"special error exceptions that you can listen to. Since this is a pretty "
"self-explanitory subject, we recommend :ref:`reading the documentation "
"<ext.error:Error Exceptions>` on this."
