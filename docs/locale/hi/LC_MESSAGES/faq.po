"The decision to become a standalone library that is now an API wrapper "
"for the Discord API was made before Danny posted his gist on GitHub about"
" ceasing development of discord.py. This is the official statement from "
"the library developer regarding this:"

"There are/will be numerous forks out there for discord.py, and because of"
" that, we cannot safely guarantee our ability to help users out who may "
"be using their own form of modified code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The original purpose of this library was to act as an extension of "
"discord.py, but due to the issue of constantly having to monkeypatch "
"solutions into their codebase to keep our library working introduced "
"extreme technical debt. Forking discord.py and building off of it does "
"not change anything from our issue of avoiding this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:31
msgid ""
"The goal of this library is to solely implement support and integrate the"
" use of interactions from the Discord API. Making this library unique in "
"a sense that we only do this seemed reasonable and within our margin of "
"standards at the time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:32
msgid ""
"The message intent will inevitably be forced as a privileged intent in "
"April 2022. The practicality of trying to support message commands will "
"be infeasible since Discord Developers have `already admitted`_ that "
"\"not wanting to implement application commands\" will not be a valid "
"reason for applying for this privileged intent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:33
msgid ""
"Forking discord.py would be a massive change to our current codebase, "
"throwing away all of the effort we've put into it so far, and basically "
"just be rewriting how v2.0a was created. That would make it nothing more "
"than discord.py-interactions at that point -- plus, we're already a "
"library that keeps very similar naming conventions as discord.py does, so"
" this is pointless."

"However, the term \"work\" is loosely structured here. Imagine it like "
"taping a hole in the wall instead of repairing the wall. We're "
"essentially \"plastering\" support for discord.py instead of doing the "
"surgery on its internal organs to make it work well with our library. As "
"it currently stands, **interactions.py and discord.py** are API wrappers."
" You will be able to run code *alongside* one another, and you will be "
"able to plug in some classes, but the data conversion **must be exact.**"

"Both of these variables ``interactions`` and ``dpy`` will be able to run "
"in the same established environment, and additionally will both function "
"properly as their respective libraries intend them to. This "
"implementation uses asyncio.gather to execute both starts simultaneously "
"as asyncio tasks, and runs them under one singular loop."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:77
msgid ""
"Compared to traditional startup commands, ``interactions.ready()`` and "
"``dpy.start()`` is used instead of the typical ``interactions.start()`` "
"and ``dpy.run()`` methods because of synchronous/async functions. "
"``asyncio.gather()`` works with coroutines, hence the transition."

msgid "What about the models, though? That's a simple answer:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:96
msgid ""
"Both of these will be able to both run and give their proper value. It is"
" *very* important to note here, though, that you **must** be returning "
"back the exact same information that our objects depend on. A missing "
"class instance can easily lead to it breaking, hence the \"plastering\" "
"that is going on here."

msgid "Where should we go with discord.py being gone?"

#: ../../faq.rst:102
msgid ""
"The most *biased* answer would be to, of course, *use interactions.py.* "
"We already offer a lot of the integral API wrapper aspects as discord.py "
"does, however, we only specialize in interactions. Which means things "
"such as these won't be supported officially by us (but might be available"
" as 3rd parties):"

"There are other libraries of course though. As a general rule of thumb, "
"if you're looking to do mainly slash commands and that tidbit then we "
"highly recommend using our library, especially as **discord-components** "
"merges as of version 4.0. But if you want something way more open and "

"It's personally recommended from the library developer to seek these "
"paths instead of sticking to an older version of a library, e.g. "
"discord.py 1.7.3 or 2.0.0a as they can eventually become deprecated with "
"more pending changes to the API by Discord engineers."

msgid "Why are you not supporting cooldowns?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:123
msgid ""
"Cooldowns aren't really an actual feature of the Discord API itself, but "

" avoid spamming of commands."

"That's the neat part: it's really hard to do that, and most of the time, "
"they won't. Unless they copy the exact string that was used when you open"
" up the UI element to do it numerous times, most users do and will not be"
" able to know how to do this. However, if you as a bot developer feel at "
"unease about this, you are more than welcome to implement your own "
"cooldown methods yourself. Cooldowns were an ultimatum that came as the "
"result of message commands being able to be spammable, and since we won't"
" be supporting them, there's no feasibility to having them in our "
"library."

msgid "Will we not be able to create message commands?"

#: ../../faq.rst:136
msgid ""
"This is a tricky question to really answer. If you want the *technical* "
"answer: you can definitely create them with our library, however, you'll "
"have to program them in the ``on_message_create`` listener event that we "
"use. This is already something a majority of discord.py bot developers "
"frown upon doing, so this is at your own risk to code your own command "
"handlers into it. Luckily, you can take a page out of discord.js' book if"
" you want to do this, since they've never heard of an external command "
"handler framework before in their entire life."
