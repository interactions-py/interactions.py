"Bots can be a little confusing to create. That's why we've decided to try"
" and make the process as streamlined as humanly possible, in order for it"
" to be friendlier to understand for our fellow bot developers. Please "
"note that **a Discord bot should not be your first project if you're "
"learning how to code**. There are plenty of other projects to consider "
"first before this, as a Discord bot is not exactly beginner-friendly."

"``@bot.application_command()`` -- This is something known as a "
"*decorator* in Python. This decorator is in charge and responsible of "
"making sure that the Discord API is told about the slash/sub command that"
" you wish to create, and sends an HTTP request correspondingly. Any "
"changes to the information contained in this decorator will be "
"synchronously updated with the API automatically for you."

"``await ctx.send(\"Hello world!\")`` -- This is what lets us send a "
"\"message\", or otherwise known as an interaction response back to the "
"Discord API for us. ``ctx`` is abbreviated as the \"context\" of the "
"command, so numerous fields and attributes such as channels, guilds; and "
